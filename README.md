# IBM-HR-Attrition-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Overview
- The rate of attrition is calculated in proportion to the total employee count in the organisation. It could be monthly, quarterly or annually.
- The cause for leaving the company could be retirement, illness, better job opportunities or personal reasons.
- The attrition rate helps you to understand the rate of permanent or semipermanent loss of employees, which can impact a business.
- Human resources uses this rate to calculate the number of vacant positions so that they can make plans to hire accordingly.
- The employee attrition rate is also referred to as the churn rate.
